## Project Summary
DNetHub allows you to make a connection from your web2 identity (Personal webpage, X account, Telegram, Discord, Youtube) to your web3 identity (wallet, decentralized profile), so the answer to the question how can someone reach me? Will just be this page.

You can be sure that who sees the page knows it is your page, less opportunities of a scam happening. With the added perk that you can take (money, payments, tips) there directly, all seamlessly in one place.

For the Testnet we've created a collection of NFTs that operates as the HNS domains in the Mainnet, so in this case you can mint domains with the form {name}-testnet.hbar, then when you access to our app you can activate a web2 domain with the form {name}-testnet.hbar.im and as the holder of the .hbar NFT you will be able to create profile pages easely accesible with any web browser. 


## Instructions for test
First you'll need to install the Hashpack wallet and create a Testnet account, then you can access to app.dnethub.xyz and pair your wallet using the "Connect Wallet" button (make sure that your wallet is unloked). 

Now you will mint a Tesnet Domain NFT, first of all search for an available name and then proceed to mint (this could take 20-30 sec). The token will be airdropped to your wallet and after refreshing the page it will appear in the dashboard.

In this step you can access to the domain administration to add data and theme your page, be sure to save your changes to make it availables.

## Future Plans
- Integration on Mainnet with the Hedera Name Service (HNS) to assign domains {name}.hbar.im, {name}.cream.co.im and {name}.boo.co.im for domains holders in our dApp
- Add Opengraph data to the DNetHub profile pages
- Add the option to generate custom pages for the domains using Markdown
- Include a Hedera DID and VCs integration on profile pages
